Roblox Software Engineer Interview Process

The interview process at Roblox predominantly tests your coding and systems design knowledge. 
You’re also asked a few behavioral questions where recruiters evaluate your attitude towards general workplace situations. 

The process consists of three main stages -- the recruiter screen, the technical phone screen interview, 
and the on-site interview. Let’s take a look at the interview process in detail: 


## Recruiter Screen

The recruiter screen is the first round that involves interacting with a human resources professional from Roblox. 
The idea behind this round is to help recruiters understand the basic attributes of your professional profile. 
You’ll be asked questions about your skills, experience, and why you’re looking to make the switch to Roblox. 
If your skills match the requirements of the role, you’ll be called for the technical phone screen interview.

##Technical Phone Screen

The technical phone screen interview is a remote interview round where a hiring manager asks you to solve a coding problem 
in data structures and algorithms. The coding problem won’t be too difficult. Hiring managers mainly seek to understand 
your approach to analytical problem solving and how you’re able to use core DSA concepts to arrive at the optimal solution. 
Understanding the problem and knowing what approach to take is key in this round. 

##On-Site Interview

The on-site interview consists of three to four rounds. A typical Roblox on-site interview will include:
1 to 2 Coding Rounds 

These rounds test your coding skills in DSA and algorithms, as well as your command on the chosen OOP language. 
The difficulty level of problem(s) in this round is usually moderate to hard. Your ability to analytically solve 
the given problem and arrive at the most optimal solution is evaluated in these rounds. Make sure to practice 
whiteboard coding as you may be asked to write your solution code on a whiteboard. 

1 to 2 Systems Design Rounds

These rounds specifically evaluate your knowledge in distributed systems design. You can expect questions on designing 
an arbitrary system with the given specifications, systems security, network protocols, and concepts in scalable systems.  
1 Behavioral Round

This round specifically focuses on evaluating specific characteristics of your personality. 
Your attitude towards workplace-related situations, general ethics in conflicting situations, 
challenging past projects, and leadership skills are evaluated.
