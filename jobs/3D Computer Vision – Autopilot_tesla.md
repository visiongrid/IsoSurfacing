# What to Expect
As a member of the Autopilot Team, you will design, train, and deploy machine learning models for perception and automated data annotation at an unprecedented scale for autonomy systems. You will utilize Tesla’s enormous compute and data generation capabilities to push the state of the art in real world applications.
What You’ll Do

    * Develop novel formulations and architectures for a wide variety of computer vision tasks.
    * Perform large-scale distributed training of deep neural networks to build a unified and consistent vector space for autonomous driving tasks (e.g., occupancy, occupancy flow, semantics, geometry, detection, drivable surface).
    * Design metrics, tasks, and datasets that aid in perception and autonomy.
    * Deploy models at scale to millions of Tesla cars in the real world.
    * Strict adherence to strong software engineering practices to develop novel work quickly and safely.

# What You’ll Bring

    * Strong experience writing production-level Python and software engineering best practices.
    * Solid mathematical fundamentals including linear algebra, vector calculus, probability theory, and numeric optimization.
    * An “under the hood” knowledge of deep learning: layer details, loss functions, optimization, etc.
    * Understanding of modern deep learning techniques (CNNs, transformers, autoregressive models, etc.).
    * Domain expertise in at least one of these areas: object detection & tracking, pose estimation, depth estimation, semantic & instance segmentation, video models, differentiable rendering, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), 3D reconstruction, visual SLAM, structure from motion.
    * Familiarity with basic computer vision concepts such as intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations, homogeneous coordinates, projection matrices, and epipolar geometry.
    * Experience with PyTorch, or at least another major deep learning framework such as TensorFlow.
    * Experience in GPU programming (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL) or GPU-accelerated libraries.
    * Comfortable working in a shared cluster environment.
