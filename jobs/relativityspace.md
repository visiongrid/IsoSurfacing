Company Overview:

Relativity is the first and only company to automate aerospace manufacturing by integrating intelligent robotics, software, and proprietary metal 3D printing technology. Disrupting 60 years of aerospace, Relativity offers a radically simplified supply chain, building a rocket with 100x fewer parts in less than 60 days. Our long-term goal is to upgrade humanity’s industrial base on Earth and on Mars.  

Team:

The Simulation Infrastructure team is responsible for building and operating the  “Operating System for Multiphysics simulations” allowing multidisciplinary customers to execute and review physics simulations to inform and guide their decision making.  The team is responsible for porting and optimizing existing simulation efforts to a cloud-centric workflow and augmenting the results from numerical analysis with ML driven exploratory analysis.

What you’ll do:

The Additive Development group is looking for a Manager, Machine Learning to join us in solving the most complex problems in Additive Manufacturing. You will be expected to leverage your leadership and problem-solving skills to architect, develop, and deploy new tools, models, and initiatives focused on a wide array of physical, technical problems and phenomena related to depositing molten metal to form an orbital launch vehicle. You will be responsible for setting the course for your team, ensuring their projects are allocated the appropriate prioritization and resources for success.

You can conceptually and analytically jump between time, frequency, and spatial domains for data analysis. Your ability to exercise technical judgment in solving engineering challenges by connecting the physical with the virtual will be necessary to manage our ML technology programs, define milestones and success criteria, and architecture. This is truly the intersection of the physical science of additive manufacturing with intelligent systems.

What you need to know:

    4+ years of software development experience in the industry, comfortable using git and Linux environments
    2+ years of hands-on experience with machine-learning frameworks and techniques with large datasets
    1+ year of managerial experience leading technical teams
    DSP, frequency domain analysis, data manipulation and sanitization best practices such as outlier detection
    Fluency in processes and infrastructure for developing, operating, and monitoring machine learning models
    Experience working in multi-disciplinary environments
    Experience collaborating with mechanical and structural engineering disciplines

Nice to haves but not required:

    Or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering or related field
    Optimization Techniques including MOO, Bayesian, and Surrogate Based Models, numerical methods for PDEs
    Experience delivering models that perform in real-time control systems
    Data Assessment: class imbalances, evaluate protected features, correlations, data representability
    Model Assessment: feature importance, model specific methods, domain knowledge abstraction, model metrics analysis
    Familiarity with:
        Unsupervised ML algorithms (i.e. SimCLR or MOCO)
        Supervised ML algorithms (YoLov4)
        uncertainty models and clustering methods (DBSCAN, Guassian Surface)
    Previously leverages CNNs for object detection, classification, localization
    Experience with the following products or libraries: DVC, ModelDB, Pachyderm, Algorithmia, Seldon, MLEAP, DEEPDETECT, ELI5, SHAP, XAI, MLFlow, SageMaker
